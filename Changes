Revision history for App-CreateSelfSignedSSLCert

0.05    2014-06-19 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Revert previous decision. App dist name should still be the name of
          the main module. When binary name is a single word (e.g. foo) then
          module name should be App::foo and dist App-foo. When binary name is
          multiple words (e.g. foo-bar-baz) then module name should use camel
          case App::FooBarBaz and dist App-FooBarBaz.
